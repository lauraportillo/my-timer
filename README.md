# My Timer

My **phone's timer** had always worked perfectly ... at least I thought so!

Until then I had only used it with minutes, but that day I needed an hour and a half. And it didn't work for me!

So I decided to make **my own timer** with **Vanilla JS** and styles using **CSS3**.

The most important thing, **the time**, is working and soon I will upload the improvements.
